# Adversarial Training Demo
This program was written as the artefact for my Final Project at University Centre West Anglia.  
It provides a basic demonstration of image classifying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the impact of adversarial perturbation on accuracy.  
It also showcases the adversarial training technique as a method of improving accuracy on data containing adversarial perturbations.
